## Tips

### 1. Use Projects for Study Topics

Organize notes into projects, then create custom sessions per project.

### 2. Preview Before Committing

Use Preview mode for AI-generated cards before they affect your schedule.

### 3. Time-Box Your Sessions

Set a time limit to avoid marathon sessions.

### 4. Mix It Up

Use random order to prevent memorizing card sequence.
