## When to Archive

### Good Reasons to Archive

- Completed a course
- Topic no longer relevant
- Taking a break from a subject
- Reducing review load temporarily
- Seasonal topics (e.g., holiday-specific)

### When NOT to Archive

- Just want to reduce reviews -- adjust daily limits instead
- Cards are difficult -- use suspend or an easier preset
- Temporary pause -- consider Easy Days feature

## Archive vs Other Options

| Action | Effect | Reversible |
|--------|--------|------------|
| Archive | Hide from reviews | Yes |
| Suspend | Pause individual cards | Yes |
| Delete | Remove permanently | No |
| Reduce limits | Fewer reviews | Yes |

## Archived Note Behavior

### Review Queue

Archived notes' cards:
- Are NOT included in due counts
- Do NOT appear in review sessions
- Keep their FSRS scheduling data

### Statistics

Archived cards:
- Are excluded from [Statistics](/views/statistics/)
- Don't count toward retention calculations
- Are hidden from most charts

### Dashboard

Archived notes:
- Hidden by default
- Show when "Show archived" enabled
- Display archive icon

### Search

Archived notes:
- Still searchable in Card Browser
- Filter with `archived:true`

## Restoring Reviews After Archive

When you unarchive:

1. Cards return to review queue
2. Due dates are recalculated based on last review
3. May have accumulated backlog

### Handling Backlog

After unarchiving, you may have many due cards:

1. Use **Postpone** to spread them out
2. Or do a cram session
3. Or adjust daily limits temporarily

## Bulk Archiving

### Multiple Notes

1. Open Dashboard
2. Select multiple notes (Shift+Click)
3. Right-click -> Archive

### By Project

Archive an entire project:

1. Assign all notes to a project
2. Archive each note
3. Or use frontmatter: set `archived: true` on all notes

## Tips

### 1. Use for Completed Courses

After finishing a course, archive those notes to reduce daily load.

### 2. Seasonal Archiving

Archive holiday-specific or seasonal content when not relevant.

### 3. Check Before Archiving

Review the note's cards before archiving to ensure you're caught up.

### 4. Unarchive Gradually

When bringing back archived content, unarchive in batches to avoid overwhelming the review queue.
