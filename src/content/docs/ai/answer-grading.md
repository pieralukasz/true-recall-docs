True Recall can use AI to grade your typed answers during review. This provides semantic evaluation that understands meaning, not just exact matches.

## How AI Grading Works

1. You type your answer during review
2. AI compares your answer with the correct one
3. AI assigns a score (0-100) and provides feedback
4. You can accept the AI score or rate manually

## Enabling AI Grading

### During Review

Press `T` to cycle: Off -> AI Grading -> Diff -> Off

### Default Mode

Settings -> General -> Default type-in mode: AI

## Grading Interface

```
Question: What is the powerhouse of the cell?

Your answer:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ The organelle that produces ATP             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘

[Submit Answer]
```

After submission:

```
Correct: Mitochondria
Yours: The organelle that produces ATP

AI Score: 85%
Feedback: Correct description! The answer
you're looking for is the specific organelle
name: Mitochondria.

[Accept & Rate Good]  [Override]
```

## Grading Behavior

## Customizing Grading

### Grading Prompt

Settings -> AI -> Type-in grading prompt

Customize how AI evaluates:

```
Grade this flashcard answer:
- Correct answer: {{correct}}
- Student answer: {{student}}

Score 0-100 where:
- 90-100: Essentially correct
- 70-89: Minor errors or incomplete
- 50-69: Partially correct
- 0-49: Incorrect

Provide brief feedback (1-2 sentences).
Be strict but fair. Minor spelling errors should score 90+.
```

### Template Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `{{correct}}` | The correct answer |
| `{{student}}` | The student's answer |
| `{{question}}` | The card's question |

## When to Use AI Grading

### Good For

- Conceptual understanding questions
- Open-ended answers
- Multiple correct answers possible
- Testing comprehension

### Less Ideal For

- Exact terminology (use Diff mode)
- Spelling practice (use Diff mode)
- Short factual answers
- Working offline

## Tips

### 1. Be Honest with Overrides

If AI says 90% but you struggled, rate Hard instead of Good.

### 2. Use for Complex Cards

AI grading shines with longer, conceptual answers.

### 3. Adjust Prompt for Your Style

If AI is too lenient, make the prompt stricter.

### 4. Check Feedback

AI feedback can help identify knowledge gaps.

## Troubleshooting

### AI Grading Not Working

1. Ensure AI is configured (API key or subscription)
2. Check network connection
3. Fall back to Diff mode if offline

### Inconsistent Grading

1. Try a more consistent model (GPT-4o)
2. Adjust grading prompt
3. Use Diff mode for exact matching

### Too Lenient/Strict

Modify the grading prompt with your desired strictness level.
