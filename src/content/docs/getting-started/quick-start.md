This guide will walk you through creating and reviewing your first flashcards with True Recall.

## Step 1: Configure Your API Key

True Recall uses OpenRouter to access AI models for flashcard generation.

1. **Get an API key** from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/keys)
2. **Open Settings** → True Recall → AI tab
3. **Paste your API key** in the "OpenRouter API Key" field
4. **Select a model** (Gemini 3 Flash recommended for best value)

:::tip
OpenRouter offers free credits for new users. Flashcard generation costs approximately $0.001-0.01 per note depending on length and model.

## Step 3: Start Reviewing

Once you have flashcards, it's time to review them:

1. **Click the brain ribbon icon** or use Command Palette → "Start review session"
2. **Read the question** displayed on the card
3. **Think of the answer** before revealing
4. **Press Space** or click "Show Answer"
5. **Rate your recall**:
   - **1 (Again)**: Forgot completely, see again soon
   - **2 (Hard)**: Struggled to recall
   - **3 (Good)**: Recalled with some effort
   - **4 (Easy)**: Recalled instantly

## Step 4: Check Your Progress

After reviewing, check your statistics:

1. **Click the chart ribbon icon** (orange) in the sidebar
2. **View today's summary**: Cards reviewed, time spent, accuracy
3. **Explore charts**: Retention over time, workload forecast, calendar heatmap

## Keyboard Shortcuts

During review sessions, these shortcuts speed up your workflow:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Space` | Show answer / Rate Good |
| `1` | Rate Again |
| `2` | Rate Hard |
| `3` | Rate Good |
| `4` | Rate Easy |
| `Cmd/Ctrl+Z` | Undo last rating |

## What's Next?

You've mastered the basics! Here's where to go next:

- **[AI Generation](/true-recall-docs/features/ai-generation/)**: Customize prompts and explore advanced generation options
- **[Review System](/true-recall-docs/features/review-system/)**: Learn about card states and scheduling
- **[FSRS Algorithm](/true-recall-docs/features/fsrs-algorithm/)**: Understand and optimize the spaced repetition algorithm
- **[Projects](/true-recall-docs/features/projects/)**: Organize flashcards into study groups

## Tips for Success

1. **Review daily**: Consistency beats intensity. 10 minutes daily is better than 1 hour weekly.
2. **Generate from quality notes**: Better notes = better flashcards.
3. **Rate honestly**: Don't inflate your ratings—the algorithm learns from your honesty.
4. **Use projects**: Group related notes for focused study sessions.
5. **Check stats weekly**: Monitor retention and adjust your study habits.
