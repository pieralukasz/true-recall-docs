True Recall can import flashcards from Anki `.apkg` files and export your cards back to Anki format.

## Importing from Anki

### Opening Import

Settings > Data & Backup > Anki Import/Export > Import .apkg

Or Command Palette > "Import Anki deck"

### Import Process

1. **Select file** -- Choose `.apkg` file
2. **Preview** -- See cards to import
3. **Configure** -- Set options
4. **Import** -- Process cards
5. **Review** -- Check imported cards

### Import Options

|--------|-------------|
| Include scheduling | Import Anki intervals and review history |
| Import media | Include images and audio |
| Map note types | Match Anki types to True Recall types |
| Target project | Assign imported cards to project |

### Note Type Mapping

Anki note types are converted:

| Basic | Basic |
| Basic (and reversed card) | Reversed |
| Cloze | Cloze |
| Image Occlusion | Image Occlusion |
| Custom | Creates new type |

### Scheduling Conversion

Anki uses SM-2, True Recall uses FSRS. Conversion:

| Anki Data | FSRS Equivalent |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Ease factor | Converted to stability |
| Interval | Used as initial interval |
| Lapses | Preserved |
| Review history | Converted to FSRS format |

### Media Files

Images and audio are:

1. Extracted from `.apkg`
2. Saved to vault attachments folder
3. Linked in cards

### Import Preview

- Number of cards
- Number of notes
- Note types found
- Media files included
- Any warnings

## Exporting to Anki
