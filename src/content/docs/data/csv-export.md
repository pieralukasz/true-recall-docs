## Filtering Export

### By State

Export only specific card states:

- New cards only
- Review cards only
- Suspended cards only

### By Project

Export cards from specific project:

```
Filter: project = "Medicine"
```

### By Note Type

Export specific card types:

```
Filter: note_type = "Cloze"
```

### By Date

Export cards created or reviewed in date range:

```
Filter: created >= "2024-01-01"
Filter: last_review >= "2024-01-15"
```

## Use Cases

### Analysis in Excel/Sheets

1. Export with scheduling data
2. Open in spreadsheet
3. Analyze patterns (lapses, intervals, etc.)

### External Backup

1. Export all cards
2. Save to cloud storage
3. Human-readable backup

### Migration

1. Export from True Recall
2. Transform data if needed
3. Import to another system

### Reporting

1. Export filtered subset
2. Create custom reports
3. Share progress with others

## Tips

### 1. Use TSV for Text with Commas

If card content contains commas, use TSV format.

### 2. Include Header Always

Headers make the file self-documenting.

### 3. Export Regularly

Periodic exports provide additional backup.

### 4. Filter for Analysis

Don't export everything when analyzing specific subsets.

## Troubleshooting

### File Too Large

1. Export without scheduling columns
2. Filter to specific cards
3. Split into multiple exports

### Encoding Issues

1. CSV uses UTF-8 encoding
2. If characters appear wrong, specify UTF-8 when opening
3. Use TSV as alternative

### Excel Doesn't Open Properly

1. Import manually: Data > From Text/CSV
2. Specify delimiter (comma or tab)
3. Set encoding to UTF-8

### Missing Columns

1. Check export options
2. Enable "Include scheduling" for FSRS data
3. Some columns require specific data
