description: How True Recall credits work for flashcard generation
---

Credits are the simplest way to use True Recall's AI-powered flashcard generation without managing your own API keys.

## What are Credits?

Credits are a prepaid balance used to generate flashcards. When you generate flashcards, credits are deducted from your balance based on the content processed.

- **1 credit ≈ 1 flashcard** generated
- Credits **never expire**
- Unused credits carry over indefinitely

## How Credits are Used

Credits are consumed when you:
- Generate flashcards from notes using AI
- Regenerate or modify existing flashcards with AI

Credits are **NOT** consumed when you:
- Review flashcards
- Manually create or edit flashcards
- Use the plugin's other features (statistics, browser, etc.)
- Use your own API key (BYOK)
