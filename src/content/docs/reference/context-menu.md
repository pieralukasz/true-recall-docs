Right-click a markdown file in the file explorer for quick access to flashcard operations.

## Available Options

| Menu Item | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Review flashcards from this note** | Start a review session with only cards from this file |
| **Create project from this note** | Create a project named after the note and add the note to it |
| **Open flashcard panel** | Open the sidebar panel showing this note's cards |

These options appear for `.md` files in your vault. On mobile, long-press instead of right-click.
