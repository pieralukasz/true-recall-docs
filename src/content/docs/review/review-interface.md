## Answer Buttons

After revealing the answer, rate your recall:

### Again (1)

- **Meaning:** You didn't remember
- **Effect:** Card goes back to learning/relearning
- **Interval:** Resets to learning steps

### Hard (2)

- **Meaning:** You remembered with significant effort
- **Effect:** Shorter than normal interval
- **Interval:** Reduced from Good interval

### Good (3) - Space

- **Meaning:** You remembered correctly
- **Effect:** Normal FSRS interval
- **Interval:** As calculated by FSRS

### Easy (4)

- **Meaning:** You remembered instantly, no effort
- **Effect:** Longer than normal interval
- **Interval:** Increased from Good interval

### Interval Preview

Each button shows the next interval:
- `<1m` -- Less than 1 minute
- `10m` -- 10 minutes
- `1.2d` -- 1.2 days
- `2.5mo` -- 2.5 months

Intervals are calculated by FSRS based on your history.

## Session States

### Waiting

No cards due right now. Shows:
- Countdown to next due card
- "Next card in X hours"

### Complete

## Ending a Session

### Early Exit

### Session Complete

After reviewing all due cards, see the summary screen:

```
+-------------------------------------+
|         Session Complete!           |
+-------------------------------------+
|  Cards reviewed: 25                 |
|  Time: 8 minutes                    |
|  Retention: 92%                     |
|                                     |
|  Again: 2  Hard: 3  Good: 18  Easy: 2|
+-------------------------------------+
|     [Review More]  [Close]          |
+-------------------------------------+
```

## Performance and scaling

- Preset-based scheduling/preview reuses cached FSRS engines instead of rebuilding them for each card.
- In global sessions, preset resolution is memoized per source note and reused for sibling cards.
- Queue and scheduling semantics are unchanged: same limits and same note/project/default preset resolution.

## Fullscreen vs Side Panel

Configure in Settings → General → Review mode:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Fullscreen** | Takes over main editor area |
| **Side panel** | Opens in right sidebar |

Fullscreen is recommended for focused study.
