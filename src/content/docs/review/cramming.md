**Cramming** lets you practice cards without affecting their scheduled review dates. Perfect for extra practice before exams or reinforcing difficult material.

## What is Cramming?

When you cram:

- Cards are shown for practice
- You rate them (Again/Hard/Good/Easy)
- **Ratings don't change scheduling**
- Next review date remains unchanged

This is different from normal review, where ratings adjust FSRS parameters and intervals.

## When to Use Cramming

| Use Cramming When | Use Normal Review When |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| Preparing for an exam | Daily spaced repetition |
| Extra practice on weak areas | Building long-term memory |
| Testing yourself before test | Following FSRS schedule |
| Practicing without consequences | Normal learning |

## Starting a Cram Session

### From Dashboard

1. Open [Dashboard](/views/dashboard/)
2. Right-click a project or note
3. Select **Custom session**
4. Choose **Cram** as session type

### From Command

Command Palette → "Cram session"

### Cram Session Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Project** | Limit to project |
| **State** | New, Review, or All |
| **Max cards** | Session limit |
| **Randomize** | Shuffle cards |

## Cram Session Flow

1. **Configure** filters and limits
2. **Review** cards and rate them
3. **See feedback** but no schedule changes
4. **Finish** when done or limit reached

### Visual Indicator

During cram sessions, the header shows "Cram" badge to distinguish from normal reviews.

## Cramming vs Normal Review

| Aspect | Cramming | Normal Review |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| Affects schedule | No | Yes |
| Updates FSRS params | No | Yes |
| Counts toward stats | No* | Yes |
| Good for | Short-term | Long-term |
| Follow-up | None | Next scheduled review |

*Cram reviews are logged but don't affect daily statistics.

## Best Practices

### Before an Exam

1. **One week before:** Normal reviews + light cramming
2. **Day before:** Cram session on exam material
3. **Day of:** Quick cram review (optional)

### For Difficult Material

If struggling with certain cards:

1. Normal review as scheduled
2. Cram session on those cards daily
3. Once comfortable, stop cramming

### Don't Overdo It

Cramming shouldn't replace normal reviews:
- Use it as a supplement
- Don't cram the same cards daily for weeks
- Let FSRS do its job for long-term retention

## Cram Session Statistics

After a cram session, you see:

| Stat | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Cards reviewed | Total cards practiced |
| Again count | How many you forgot |
| Accuracy | Percentage correct |

These are for your information only -- they don't affect the database.
